Create your unique content blocks right from within the Headway Grid editor using the Views plugin.

== Description ==

= Create your own content in Headway sites with Views =

**Headway Views** lets Headway users create unique content blocks, right from the Grid Editor, using **Views**.

While you can build virtually anything, here are a few basic examples of Views blocks that you can create, in 10 minutes or less:

* Tables
* Grids
* Content lists
* Sliders

Use it to display products, testimonials, a showcase of your work, sliders, custom galleries and more. Views doesn’t limit you to specific designs. You can create your own with whatever you need.

Views can display standard WordPress content, as well as any custom content that you define. You’ll be able to display custom fields, taxonomy and everything that you can possibly create with WordPress.

= Powered by Views - the ultimate site-building framework for WordPress =

[Views](http://wp-types.com/home/views-create-elegant-displays-for-your-content/) lets you build WordPress sites at a fraction of the time it takes to code them.
You could create custom post templates, load database content and display it – all from the WordPress admin. Views could be incorporated into any project with maximum theme and plugin compatibility to list your custom post types with specific post relationship, custom field definitions and a number of styling options such as AJAX pagination or slider for your content entries.

Views comes from OnTheGoSystems, the creators of [WPML](http://wpml.org/) and [Types](http://wp-types.com/home/types-manage-post-types-taxonomy-and-custom-fields/), which implies perfect integration with both plugins for multilingual based websites and custom post type management.

= Coming Soon - Build e-commerce sites with Headway Views =
We’re almost there! The next Views release will allow you to build complete e-commerce sites with the most popular open source e-commerce plugins. You’ll be able to create a product catalog, checkout and order pages right from the Headway admin using Views.
